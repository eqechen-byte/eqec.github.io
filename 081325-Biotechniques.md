## This is my first blog post. I would write something about biotechniques.
### CT
#### Mechanism
- Scans produce cross-section images of the brain using x-ray radiation
- A beam of x-rays aim at a patient from all angles
- Denser tissue absorbs more of the x-ray radiation so shows up as a lighter region on a scan
#### Result
- Shows physical structures of the brain and allows visualisation of any tissue damage(bleeding, due to density difference)
- The scans do not directly show the functions of the regions of the brain

### MRI


 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
